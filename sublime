The popular cross-platform Sublime Text editor finally offers official Linux apt repository to make it easy to install and receive update in Ubuntu.

Sublime Text is a proprietary source code editor with a Python API. It supports many programming languages and markup languages, and its functionality can be extended by users with plugins.

It’s available to download and use for free, but you’re supposed to buy a license if you plan on using it full-time.

Install Sublime Text 3 via the official apt repository:
1. Open terminal via Ctrl+Alt+T or by searching for “Terminal” from desktop app launcher. When it opens, run command to install the key:

wget -qO - https://download.sublimetext.com/sublimehq-pub.gpg | sudo apt-key add -

2. Then add the apt repository via command:

echo "deb https://download.sublimetext.com/ apt/stable/" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sublime-text.list

3. Finally check updates and install sublime-text via your system package manager:

or by running commands:

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install sublime-text
Once installed, launch it from your desktop app launcher and enjoy!

Uninstall:
To uninstall the editor, either use your system package manager or simply run command:

sudo apt-get remove sublime-text && sudo apt-get autoremove

And the official Sublime Text apt repository can be removed by going to System Settings -> Software & Updates -> Other Software tab.
