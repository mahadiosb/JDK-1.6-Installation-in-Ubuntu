This answer is not useful
this is what works

Open the file /opt/lampp/etc/httpd.conf
Search the "Listen 80" and change it to some other port (eg Listen 8000)
Open the file /opt/lampp/etc/extra/httpd-ssl.conf
Search the "Listen 443" and change it to some other port (eg Listen 4431)
Open the file "/opt/lampp/lampp"
Search for the port "testport 80" and replace it to "testport 8000". Also change the "testport 443" to "testport 4431".
Now go and run "/opt/lampp/lampp start". (It works now).
